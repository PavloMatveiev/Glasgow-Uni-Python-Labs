# First Year Lab Solutions - University of Glasgow

Welcome to my repository where I share the solutions to the labs I completed during my first year at the University of Glasgow. Each lab paper corresponds to a particular week of the academic year and the solutions are presented in Jupyter Notebook files contained in zip archives.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organised by week, and each week's lab solutions are stored in a zip file named `week_x_lab_solution.zip`, where `x` is the week number from 1 to 18.

### Example:
- `week_1_lab_solution.zip`
- `week_2_lab_solution.zip`
- ...
- `week_18_lab_solution.zip`

## How to Use

To use solutions from this repository, follow these steps:
1. Select the week for which you need a lab solution.
2. Download the appropriate zip file.
3. Unzip the zip file to access the Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) files.
4. Open Jupyter Notebooks in an environment that supports IPython Notebooks, such as JupyterLab or Google Colab.

## Contributing

Although this repository is primarily for my personal archival purposes, any suggestions or corrections from students and faculty are welcome. Please feel free to submit a correction request or open an issue if you find any discrepancies or would like to suggest improvements.

## Contact

If you have any questions or would like to contact me about this repository, please submit a request in the repository issue tracker.
